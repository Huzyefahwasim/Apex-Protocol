# Apex Protocol

![Apex Protocol Banner](public/og.png)

**Apex Protocol** is a conceptual high-performance fitness application landing page that merges bio-hacking aesthetics with modern web technologies. This project demonstrates a "Cyberpunk Athletics" visual style, treating the human body as hardware to be upgraded.

## 🚀 Concept

The core design philosophy is to translate the "Web3/Data-Economy" aesthetic (inspired by sites like nvg8.io) into a "Human Performance" context.
Key visual pillars:
- **Dark Mode only**: Deep charcoal/black backgrounds.
- **Neon Accents**: Electric Cyan (`#00fff2`) and Neon Magenta (`#ff00c8`).
- **Glassmorphism**: Translucent UI cards with glowing borders.
- **Data Visualization**: Monospaced typography and technical readouts.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js 14+](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Animation**: 
  - [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) (ScrollTrigger) associated with deep scroll interactions.
  - [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for component-level micro-interactions.
- **3D**: [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber) (drei/fiber)
- **Smoothing**: [Lenis](https://github.com/darkroomengineering/lenis) for smooth scroll interpolation.

## ⚡ Features

- **Staggered Entrance**: Hero section with split-text reveal animations.
- **Scrub-linked Text**: Large typography that reveals itself (adjusts opacity) based on scroll position.
- **Sticky Bento Modules**: A "sticky-stack" section where feature cards scroll past a pinned header.
- **Magnetic Cursor**: Custom cursor that snaps to interactive elements.
